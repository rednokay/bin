# Small Little Scripts

This repo contains some of scrips I use for convenience or whatever.

## compiler

This is inspired by @LukeSmithxyz Luke Smith (https://github.com/lukesmithxyz) and compiles the current project you are working on. It detects the programming language automatically and can be i.e. run from within Neovim or other editors.

## vidsAndPics

Simple tool that crawls folders and gives some simple data on the image and video composition inside that folder and its sub-folders.
